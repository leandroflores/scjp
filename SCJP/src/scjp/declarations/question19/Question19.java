 * Question 19. Correct the code in AnimalXyZ.java:
 */
class Question19 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {}
}

/**
 * Please choose all the answers that apply:
 * a) Remove the "x#" comments, they are placed in wrong places
 * b) Move the package and the import statements at the beginning of the file
 * c) Make "Animal" and "Dog" abstract as they do NOT implement the run() from 
 *    the Runnable interface
 * d) Remove the "public" from "Dog", as only one class can be public in a .java file
 * e) - Rename "Animal" to "AnimalXyZ" as the only public class in a .java file 
 *      must match the name of the file
 *    - OR make ALL classes in the file "default"
 * f) "import java.lang.Runnable;" is necessary at beginning of the file
 * 
 * R: b, c, d, e
